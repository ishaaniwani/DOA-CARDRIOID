## DOA-CARDIOID

By Ishaan Sinha 

## Introduction 
This simulation estimates the direction of arrival of multiple sound sources using a rectangular Cardrioid Array. This is part of my ongoing research project with the Teuscher Laboratory

## Testing and Experimentation

This simulation requires installation of the MATLAB and the Phased Array System Toolbox Offered By MATHWORKS. Note that you will also have to download all the software that the Phased Array System Toolbox requires, which is all offered by MATHWORKS. 

Individual files are individual experiments, so running one file is sufficient to run the simulation.
